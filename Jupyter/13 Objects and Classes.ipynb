    "Objects are a way to mimic the real world in coding. If you take the concept of a person, they can have a name, address, height, all of these properties that change from person to person. Object oriented coding packages that type of information, so that you can easily make a person with all those details. There are lots of stuff you can do with objects, but for now you can start with the basics."
